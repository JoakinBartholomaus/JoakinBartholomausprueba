    <h1>Joakin Bartholomaus Dietrich</h1>
    <h3>4to año Ingeniería Civil Industrial</h3>
    <p> I am Joakin Bartholomaus Dietrich, a fourth-year student
         of Industrial Civil Engineering at the Universidad de los Andes. 
         With a strong interest in finance and economics, I have excelled 
         in courses such as accounting and microeconomics, achieving the 
         highest grade in my cohort. This academic achievement has led me 
         to become a teaching assistant for these subjects. Additionally, 
         I have practical experience as a teaching assistant for accounting and 
         financial statements, as well as microeconomics. My coursework has also 
         included programming courses such as databases and programming paradigms, 
         further expanding my skill set. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills
          in a professional setting, particularly in the field of finance and economics.
    </p>
